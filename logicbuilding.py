#Note: & in Python
# The ‘&‘ symbol is a bitwise AND operator in Python, it is also known as a bitwise AND operator.
# It operates on the bitwise representation of integers.

# Note: The ‘and‘ keyword in Python is used in the logical operations. It is used to combine two logical statements, 
# it returns TRUE if both are correct and FALSE if any of the statements is wrong.
